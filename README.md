# Flatten
Flatten is a CLI tool that takes a directory as input and outputs a flat representation of its contents to stdout. It recurses into subdirectories and collects every file (even large ones, if you enable that) in a single readable listing. It’s handy for quick overviews, backups, or curious exploration.

## Features
You can toggle metadata details like last modified time, file permissions, sizes, checksums, and more. You can also include or exclude certain special files or directories with options like `--include-git`, `--include-gitignore`, or `--include-bin` if you want your binary files included.

## Install
Grab Go 1.21 or newer, clone this repository, then run:
```
go build -o flatten ./cmd/flatten
```
Place the resulting `flatten` binary somewhere in your PATH.

Or simply:
```
go install github.com/agusx1211/flatten/cmd/flatten@latest
```

## Requisites
Just a recent version of Go. There are a few external libraries for CLI and .gitignore parsing, but they’re fetched automatically when you build or install.

## Limitations
Flatten doesn’t do partial merges or transformations, it just gathers files and prints them out. If your directory is massive, the output can get really big. If you skip binary files, that might miss some unusual ones.

## Example
If you run `flatten .` in a small project, you might see something like:

```
- Total files: 4
- Total size: 18368 bytes
- Dir tree:
.
├── .gitignore
├── cmd
│   └── flatten
│       ├── filter.go
│       └── main.go
└── go.mod

- path: .gitignore
- content:
/dist/
/node_modules/
```

And so on, with optional metadata if you enabled it.
